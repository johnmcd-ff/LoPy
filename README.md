Our kit consists of:
2 x LoPy pcbs
2 x expansion pcbs
2 x antenna
2 x cases

Connect the LoPy board to the expansion board.  Take note of orientation: Insert the module on the expansion board with the reset button pointing in the same direction as the USB connector.
Fit the antenna tail coax to the case using the lock washer and nut supplied.  It's important to connect the antenna to the LoPy to prevent damage to the RF circuit from an unmatched output.
